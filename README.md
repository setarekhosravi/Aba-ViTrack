## Install the environment
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA 10.2. Please install related libraries before running this code:
   ```
   conda create -n abavitrack python=3.8
   conda activate abavitrack
   bash install.sh
   ```

## Model and raw results
The trained model and the raw tracking results are provided in the [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/13aXfsihrbrh8WMu6XYTthA?pwd=nen9)(code: nen9) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17FYC5xl8EaBL21Zbhj7yQcU0lg9mblwx?usp=drive_link).

## Run demo
Download the model and put it in checkpoints

   ```
   python demo.py --initial_bbox 499 421 102 179 
   ```
